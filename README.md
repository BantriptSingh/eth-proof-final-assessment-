# eth-proof-final-assessment

For this assessment, we will create a contract together to fulfill the following requirements:

Your contract will have public variables that store the details about your coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply)
Your contract will have a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint)
You will have a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance of the address by that amount.
Your contract will have a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply and from the balance of the address.
Lastly, your burn function should have conditionals to make sure the balance of account is greater than or equal to the amount that is supposed to be burned.

       REQUIREMENTS
    1. Your contract will have public variables that store the details about your coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply)
    
    2. Your contract will have a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint)
    
    3. You will have a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. 
       The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance 
       of the “sender” address by that amount
       
    4. Your contract will have a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. 
       It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply 
       and from the balance of the “sender”.
       
    5. Lastly, your burn function should have conditionals to make sure the balance of "sender" is greater than or equal 
       to the amount that is supposed to be burned.

some important ecplanations to understand it better.

Constructor
A constructor is a special function that is automatically called when a contract is deployed. It is used to initialize the contract's state variables and perform any setup necessary for the contract.


Mint Functio
The mint function is responsible for creating new tokens and assigning them to a specified address. This increases both the total supply of the tokens and the balance of the recipient address.

Burn Function
The burn function is responsible for destroying tokens from a specified address. This decreases both the total supply of the tokens and the balance of the specified address.
